# Recipe Recommender System
This study explores the relationship between user ratings of recipes and key recipe attributes such as nutritional information, ingredients, and categories (tags). 
By analyzing a large dataset containing recipe names, descriptions, ingredients, directions, nutritional information, user ratings, and reviews, this project seeks to uncover 
patterns and correlations that reveal how nutrition profiles (e.g., calories, fats, proteins) and specific ingredients or dietary categories (e.g., vegan, gluten-free) influence user preferences.
